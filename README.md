## 💡 How It Works

### The Problem
AI writing tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and others frequently use em dashes (—) as a crutch for sentence structure. This creates text that sounds artificial and reduces reader trust.

**Example of AI-generated text:**
```
The market is expanding rapidly — driven by consumer demand — and companies 
are adapting their strategies — focusing on digital transformation — to stay competitive.
```

### The Solution
EM DASH KILLER analyzes context around each dash and replaces it with appropriate punctuation:

**After processing:**
```
The market is expanding rapidly, driven by consumer demand, and companies 
are adapting their strategies. Focusing on digital transformation, they stay competitive.
```

### Intelligence Features
- **Sentence Detection:** New sentences get periods
- **Conjunction Handling:** Coordinating conjunctions get semicolons
- **Dialogue Processing:** Speech tags get colons
- **Default Replacement:** Most cases get commas for natural flow
